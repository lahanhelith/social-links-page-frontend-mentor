## My process

### Built with

- Vanilla HTML5
- Vanilla CSS


### What I learned

I learned how to use relative CSS units to make the webpage responsive and used em and rem units to allow accessibility features.

### Useful resources

- [Are You Using the Right CSS Units -- Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5wpD9Ov_To) - This encouraged me use em and rem units even more in CSS and I'd recommend it for anyone who is confused on how to use the units in CSS.
- [A CSS Unit Deep Dive - Learn CSS Units & When To Use Them -- Slaying The Dragon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzZTvLmmTzM) - This video teaches about the main CSS units used in web development and how they work (I would recommend you skip the section that talks about the theory behind the px unit if you are a beginner unless you want to know more).
